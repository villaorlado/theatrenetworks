# Folder organization

The **input** folder has two subfolders:
- **rawcsv**, has all the data for all three companies.
- **dividedsamples** has already split the data in before and after a major event. 

# Divisions

The divisions (between "\_after" and "\_before" files) are explained as follows:

- For *Garasi* it indicates the productions before and after they received a major funding increase (2001). 
- For *KLPAC* it indicates the productions before and after they changed venue after a massive flooding (2003). This was tied to changes in structure and funding. 
- For *TNS* it indicates the productions before and after they moved from the city center to the heartlands of Singapore (2000), with a change in mission and funding. _3Some_ was the first play in the new venue. 

## Notes

- The data are chronological but have no dates.
- The data only includes the creative roles (directors, playwrights, etc.). But more comprehensive data with admin and technical staff has also been collected.
