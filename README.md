# Folder

The input folder has two folders:
- *rawcsv*, has all the data for all three companies.
- *dividedsamples* has already split the data in before and after a major event. 

# Divisions

The divisions (between "\_after" and "\_before" files) are explained as follows:

- For Garasi it refers to before and after they received a major funding increase (2001). 
- For KLPAC before and after they changed venue after a massive flooding (2003). This was tied to changes in structure and funding. 
- For TNS before and after they moved from the city center to the heartlands of Singapore (2000). _3Some_ was the first play in the new venue. 

Notes:
The data are chronological but have no dates.
The data only includes the creative roles (directors, playwrights, etc.). But more comprehensive data with admin and technical staff has also been collected.
